# Hybrid Search RAG with Vector Database & LangChain

A robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application combining hybrid search techniques—vector similarity and keyword search—using LangChain framework and a vector database backend for improved semantic relevance and retrieval accuracy.

##  Features

- **Hybrid Search**: Integrates semantic search (via embedding similarity) with traditional keyword-based search (e.g., BM25 or full-text) for enhanced retrieval precision.  
  *Note: Hybrid search support depends on your chosen vector store—LangChain examples include Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, etc.* citeturn0search1turn0search9
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain to orchestrate document ingestion, vector embeddings, retrieval, and response generation.
- **Vector Database Support**: Supports scalable vector stores (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) optimized for semantic search. Milvus integration with LangChain provides out-of-the-box hybrid search capabilities and advanced retrieval options citeturn0search6.

##  Repository Contents

- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `search.ipynb` — Notebook demonstrating document ingestion, index creation, and hybrid search usage.
- Additional scripts or modules as required for embeddings, indexing, and query flow (update as needed).

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to a vector database (e.g., Pinecone API, Milvus server, etc.)
- API keys or credentials (if using managed services like Pinecone).

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RandomRohit-hub/Hybrid-Search-RAG-With-Vector-Database-And-Langchain.git
cd Hybrid-Search-RAG-With-Vector-Database-And-Langchain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Copy environment template and fill secrets:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Set:
   - Vector database credentials (`PINECONE_API_KEY`, `MILVUS_HOST`, etc.)
   - Embedding model (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face)

### Usage

Explore the `search.ipynb` notebook for workflow examples:

1. **Document Ingestion** – chunking and embedding text.
2. **Indexing** – create vector index with hybrid configurations (e.g., `use_hybrid=True`).
3. **Retrieval** – run queries using the hybrid retriever.
4. **RAG Pipeline** – generate answers using retrieved context.

##  How It Works

- **Vector Search** enables semantic retrieval via embedding similarity.
- **Keyword Search** (via BM25/full-text) captures exact keyword matches.
- **Hybrid Retrieval** balances both, improving relevance across diverse queries citeturn0search11turn0search3.

##  Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To help improve:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch.
2. Commit your changes and open a Pull Request.
3. Detail the purpose of your enhancements (e.g., adding support for a new vector store, improving indexing logic, performance optimizations).

###  Notes & Suggestions

- If you chose a specific vector database (e.g., Pinecone or Milvus), consider adding a “Supported Databases” section with setup instructions.
- Include code snippets that clearly show how to initialize the hybrid retriever using LangChain.
- Add sample queries and expected outputs.
